## Features

- #### Breakdown

    - Provides an input field for adding new tasks: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list by typing them into the input field and clicking the "Add" button. The code checks that the input is not empty before adding the new task to the list.
    - Renders existing tasks from local storage: When the page loads, the code checks if there are any tasks stored in local storage. If there are, it renders them in the task list.
    - Displays tasks in a container with a checkbox and delete button for each item: Tasks are displayed in a container with a white background and a shadow effect. Each task is displayed as a list item with a checkbox on the left and a delete button on the right.
    - Allows users to mark tasks as complete or incomplete with a line-through decoration: When a user checks a task as complete, it is displayed with a line-through decoration. When a user unchecks a completed task, the line-through decoration is removed.
    - Allows users to delete tasks with a fade-out animation, which also removes them from local storage: When a user clicks on the delete button, the task is removed from the list and also from local storage.
