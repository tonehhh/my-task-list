# My Task List

The website "What is the Bauhuas" serves as a landing point for anyone who are either familiar with or curious about the background of the renowned Bauhaus school of design.
What is the Bauhaus presents a succinct history of the institution, its founder Walter Gropius, and its design philosophies together with pertinent photos and videos.

People will be able to learn about Bauhaus's brief but informative history in the website's introduction as well as the beauty of its designs and artworks in the gallery section. They can also sign up for a newsletter in the sign-up section to receive additional information, the most recent news, and resources related to Bauhaus.

## Testing
- I've tested the page and everything works fine on different browsers such as Chrome, Brave and Safari.
- I can also confirm that the page's responsiveness looks good on both mobile and tablet screens using relevant devices and devtools device toolbar.
- The navigation, header, introduction, gallery, sign up and footer sections and text are all readable and are clear.
- The sign up sections works perfectly, requiring and only accepting emails in the email field. The submit button also works and has a added animation for confirmation of action.

#### Bugs
- ##### Solved Bugs
    - When i first deployed my project to GitHub I noticed that my project was broken, none of the CSS was working.
    - I realised I had used an absolute file path was causing the issue like below
##

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

- Performance
    - I also realised that the performance was alot slower than expected.
    - I figured out the performance was lacking due to using large PNG files for the images and originally having an autoplay video was causing it.
    - I compressed and converted the images to WEBP files and changed from having a video autoplaying in the background to one having controls and giving users the option to play when they need to.
    - This resulted in the page having almost a doubled performance score from previous and was no longer suffering from any unnecessary lag.
  

#### Validator Testing
- ##### HTML
    - No errors were found when testing through the official W3C validator.
- ##### CSS
    - No errors were found when testing through the official Jigsaw validator.
